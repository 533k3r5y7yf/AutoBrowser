AutoBrowser
===========

autoBrowser screenshot is a tool written in python language that used for penetration testing checks.
The purpose of this tool is to parse nmap (Port scanner) results or just a simple text file that contain ip addresses and ports (for example 127.0.0.1:31337)
    and send a http/s request to each live host with his open port number using popular Web Browsers such as:
    * Internet Explorer
    * Mozilla Firefox
    * Google Chrome
    * Safari
and grab a screenshot of the returned page content.
This tool is for IT people that did a network penetration test check and exported the result from nmap or any other network tool that checks for alive host in specific port number
so they can automate their test which make our life easier (No Hard Work!).
